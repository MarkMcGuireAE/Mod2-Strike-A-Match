# Strike-A-Match
This game was developed as my second major coding project during week 11 of the 15 week Per Scholas Software Engineering program. This is an updated version of an early internet game created by BoxerJam during the AOL dial-up days. This was a game my family would spend hours playing when I was a child, and one that you can no longer find anywhere online.

### Basic Rules/How to Play Strike-A-Match
Strike-A-Match, is a word association game based on one of the original BoxerJam games that were released with AOL in early internet days!
The goal of this game is simple. Simply match the 3 or 4 words that share a commonality.

In round 1, players are given 6 words, 3 are random, and the other 3 share a commonality. In round 1, the word these other's share in common is given to you! Each matching word set is worth 250 points! If you guess incorrectly, you lose 250 points. You move to the next round, by accumulating 1000 points! 

In round 2, players are given 9 words, 6 are random, and the other 3 share a commonality. In round 2, the word these other's share in common is given to you! Each matching word set is worth 500 points! If you guess incorrectly, you lose 500 points. You move to the next round, by accumulating 3000 points!
        
In round 3, players are given 12 words, 8 are random, and the other 4 share a commonality. In round 3, the word these other's share in common is hidden from you! Each matching word set is worth 500 points! If you guess incorrectly, you lose 500 points. You move to the next round, by accumulating 5000 points!

If at anytime, you lose too many points, your game is over, and you will be asked to restart the game!
